## mkdir

```
mkdir temp

mkdir temp/stuff

mkdir temp/stuff/things
```
```
mkdir -p temp/stuff/things/fran/jo/alice/jane
```
What do you think the option `p` mean? Try creating the the following directory without the `p` option.

```
mkdir temp/test/temp
```

```
mkdir temp/stuff/"I have fun"
```

## Check Your Work

```
ls -lR temp
```

Explain what the flags `l` and `R` do?

Did you know you can chain options together?

## Changing Directories

`cd` to the `jo` directory with one command.

`cd` back to `temp` with one command, but not further above that.

Find out how to `cd` to your "home directory" with one command.

`cd` to your `Documents` directory, then find it with your file browser.

`cd` to your `Downloads` directory, then find it with your file browser.

Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory `I Have Fun`, then you can do: `cd "I Have Fun"`
