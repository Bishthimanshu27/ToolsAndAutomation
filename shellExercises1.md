Starting in your home directory, print out the path of your home directory to the terminal.

Make a new directory in your home directory call 'shellExercise'

Change your directory into the new directory you just made

Create a new file called index.html

Create a new file called `main.js`

Create a new file called `styles.css`

List the files your current directory

From here, create two more directories called `js` and one called `css`, but this time try doing it in one command.

Move the `styles.css` file into the `css` directory and the `main.js` file into the `js` directory
